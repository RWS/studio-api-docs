# Writing style guide 
This topic aims to give you a good understanding about how to leverage language, structure sentences and documents to convey ideas or concepts in the best way possible.

## Active voice vs passive voice
In an active voice sentence, an actor acts on a target. That is, an active voice sentence follows this formula:
> Active Voice Sentence = actor + verb + target

A passive voice sentence reverses the formula. That is, a passive voice sentence typically follows the following formula:
> Passive Voice Sentence = target + verb + actor

Here's a short example for active voice:
> The cat sat on the mat.

* actor: The cat
* verd: sat 
* target: the mat

Here's a short example for passive voice: 
> The mat was sat on by the cat

* target: The mat
* passive verb: was sat
* actor: the cat

Some passive voice sentences omit an actor. For example:
> The mat was sat on.

* actor: unknown
* passive verb: was sat
* target: the mat

### Prefer active voice to passive voice

Use the active voice most of the time. Use the passive voice sparingly. Active voice provides the following advantages:

* Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice. Why subject your readers to extra processing time? By sticking to active voice, readers can skip the preprocessor stage and go straight to compilation.
* Passive voice obfuscates your ideas, turning sentences on their head. Passive voice reports action indirectly.
* Some passive voice sentences omit an actor altogether, which forces the reader to guess the actor's identity.
* Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice.

## Clear sentences
Many technical writers believe that the verb is the most important part of a sentence. Pick the right verb and the rest of the sentence will take care of itself. Unfortunately, some writers reuse only a small set of mild verbs, which is like serving your guests stale crackers and soggy lettuce every day. Picking the right verb takes a little more time but produces more satisfying results.

To engage and educate readers, choose precise, strong, specific verbs. Reduce imprecise, weak, or generic verbs, such as the following:

* forms of be: is, are, am, was, were, etc.
* occur
* happen
For example, consider how strengthening the weak verb in the following sentences ignites a more engaging sentence:

| Weak Verb | Strong Verb |
| The exception occurs when dividing by zero. | Dividing by zero raises the exception. |


Many writers rely on forms of be as if they were the only spices on the rack. Sprinkle in different verbs and watch your prose become more appetizing. That said, a form of be is sometimes the best choice of verb, so don't feel that you have to eliminate every form of be from your writing.

Note that generic verbs often signal other ailments, such as:

* an imprecise or missing actor in a sentence
* a passive voice sentence
