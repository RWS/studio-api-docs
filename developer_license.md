# Request a Developer License

## Selecting the Right License
Trados currently offers two primary license types for developers:

**Desktop License for Trados Studio**  
- Grants full functionality of Trados Studio on a single computer.  
- Ideal for creating desktop-based integrations or customizations.

**Cloud License for Trados Team or Enterprise**  
- Provides access to Trados capabilities in a cloud-based environment.  
- Best suited for solutions requiring team collaboration, centralized project management, and cloud workflows.

## Apply for a Developer License

Send an email to [app-signing@rws.com](mailto:app-signing@rws.com) with the following information:  
1. **Full name and address** (for identification).  
2. **Reason for requesting a developer license** (e.g., custom integrations, automation scripts, Trados Studio plugin development, Trados Cloud add-on development, etc.).  
3. **Affiliated company and contact person**: If applicable, specify the company you are working for and who the contact person would be (especially if representing an existing customer).  
4. **Intended solutions and pricing details**: Indicate whether you plan to offer solutions developed with the dev license on the AppStore and if you intend to charge for them. Understanding the potential impact and reach of your solution helps RWS assess your request.
