Loading and Saving the Settings
===

In this chapter we will learn how to implement the class that is actually responsible for physically storing the settings and for loading the plug-in settings into the plug-in UI. The physical storing occurs in an **.sdlproj* or in an **.sdltpl* file, which are both XML compliant.

**.sdlproj* files are automatically created for each document that is opened for translation/editing in Var:ProductName or for each project that is created in the application. These files contain project-specific information such as the translation memories/termbases used for a project as well as any project-specific settings, which can also include plug-in settings. An **.sdltpl* file is a project template, which users can create to streamline project creation.

The settings bundle stored in an **.sdlproj* file as used by our implementation would look, for example, as shown below:

# [Xml](#tab/tabid-1)
```xml
<SettingsGroup Id="Word 2007 v 2.0.0.0">
      <Setting Id="Enable">True</Setting>
    </SettingsGroup>
```

Loading and Saving the Settings
In this chapter we will learn how to implement the class that is actually responsible for physically storing the settings and for loading the plug-in settings into the plug-in UI. The physical storing occurs in an *.sdlproj or in an *.sdltpl file, which are both XML compliant.

*.sdlproj files are automatically created for each document that is opened for translation/editing in Var:ProductName or for each project that is created in the application. These files contain project-specific information such as the translation memories/termbases used for a project as well as any project-specific settings, which can also include plug-in settings. An *.sdltpl file is a project template, which users can create to streamline project creation.

The settings bundle stored in an *.sdlproj file as used by our implementation would look, for example, as shown below:

# [Xml](#tab/tabid-2)
```xml
<SettingsGroup Id="Word 2007 v 2.0.0.0">
      <Setting Id="Enable">True</Setting>
    </SettingsGroup>
```
***

Each **Setting** element contains an **Id** attribute that denotes the setting (property) name. The **Setting** element encloses the property value, which is changed when the user changes the settings in the UI.

Add the VerifierSettings Class
--

Start by adding a new class to your project called ```VerifierSettings```. Make sure that your class uses the following namespaces:

* **Sdl.Core.Settings**
* **Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.Settings**


Moreover, the component needs to be derived from the ```FileTypeSettingsBase``` class, which provides the methods required for storing and saving settings to the bundle.

Implement the Setting Properties
--

In this step, add the property that represents our plug-in setting, in this case the boolean property ```CheckWordArt```, which determines whether the verification functionality should be active or not. The ```MaxWordCount``` property is used to set or retrieve the maximum number of words a particular segment is allowed to have.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-3)
```cs
bool _checkWordArt;
int _maxWordCount;

public bool CheckWordArt
{
    get { return _checkWordArt; }
    set
    {
        _checkWordArt = value;
        OnPropertyChanged("CheckWordArt");
    }
}

public int MaxWordCount
{
    get { return _maxWordCount; }
    set
    {
        _maxWordCount = value;
        OnPropertyChanged("MaxWordCount");
    }
}
```
***

Implement the Constructor Method
--

The ```ResetToDefaults``` method is provided by the base class. In our implementation, it is just overridden to set the ```MaxWordCount``` and ```CheckWordArtproperties``` to their default values, i.e. 3 and True:

# [C#](#tab/tabid-4)
```cs
public override void ResetToDefaults()
{
    CheckWordArt = true;
    MaxWordCount = 3;
}
```
***

Reset to Defaults
--

Next, implement the constructor method. In this implementation, the constructor just calls on the ```ResetToDefaults``` of the class to set the ```CheckWordArt``` property to its default value, which is True, and 3 as the maximum word count:
# [C#](#tab/tabid-5)
```cs
public VerifierSettings()
{
    ResetToDefaults();
}
```
***

Set the Properties to the Values from the Settings Bundle
--

The base class provides the ```PopulateFromSettingsBundle``` method to retrieve the current setting from the bundle in the **.sdlproj* file and set the ```CheckWordArt``` and the ```MaxWordCount``` properties of our implementation accordingly.

In the **.sdlproj* or **.sdltpl* file a settings bundle can look, for example, as shown below:

# [Xml](#tab/tabid-6)
```xml
<SettingsBundle Guid="e0873e01-9da4-4e37-80e5-a35fc844f03d">

   <SettingsGroup Id="Word 2007 v 2.0.0.0">
     <Setting Id="MaxWordCount">3</Setting>
     <Setting Id="CheckWordArt">True</Setting>
   </SettingsGroup>

   <SettingsGroup Id="TermVerifierSettings">
     <Setting Id="Enabled">True</Setting>
   </SettingsGroup>

 </SettingsBundle>
```
***

A **SettingsBundle** element can enclose a number of **SettingsGroup** nodes. Each settings bundle has a unique id (guid) that is stored in an attribute. The settings bundles are identified by the id of the plug-in that they refer to. A settings group can enclose, for example, file type settings, verification plug-in settings, etc. In the above example the settings bundle encloses one settings group for the term verifier plug-in and another settings group for our sample WordArt verifier plug-in. This id is retrieved from the File Type Component Builder (see [Create a New File Type Component Builder](create_new_file_type_component_builder.md)).

This XML structure is also reflected in the API. Within the ```SaveToSettingsBundle``` method we create a settings group object based on ```ISettingsGroup``` by applying the ```GetSettingsGroup``` method to the settings bundle. This method takes the settings bundle id (e.g. *Word 2007 v 2.0.0.0*) as string parameter. We then use the ``GetSettingFromSettingsGroup`` method to set the ```CheckWordArt``` and the ```MaxWordCount``` properties. This method requires the settings group object, the name of the setting (e.g. *CheckWordArt*), and the default value as parameters.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-7)
```cs
public override void PopulateFromSettingsBundle(ISettingsBundle settingsBundle, string configurationId)
{
    ISettingsGroup settingsGroup = settingsBundle.GetSettingsGroup(configurationId);
    ResetToDefaults();
    CheckWordArt = GetSettingFromSettingsGroup(settingsGroup, "CheckWordArt", CheckWordArt);
    MaxWordCount = GetSettingFromSettingsGroup(settingsGroup, "MaxWordCount", MaxWordCount);
}
```
***

Set the Properties to the Values from the Settings Bundle
--

The base class also provides the ```SaveToSettingsBundle``` method, which is required to physically store the value of the two properties in the bundle of the *.sdlproj file.

Here too, we create a settings group object based on ```ISettingsGroup``` by applying the ```GetSettingsGroup``` method to the settings bundle.

Then we use the ```UpdateSettingInSettingsGroup``` method to save the settings into the physical representation. This method takes the settings group object, the setting name (string), the setting value, and the default value as parameters.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-8)
```cs
public override void SaveToSettingsBundle(ISettingsBundle settingsBundle, string configurationId)
{
    ISettingsGroup settingsGroup = settingsBundle.GetSettingsGroup(configurationId);
    var defaults = new VerifierSettings();
    UpdateSettingInSettingsGroup(settingsGroup, "CheckWordArt", CheckWordArt, defaults.CheckWordArt);
    UpdateSettingInSettingsGroup(settingsGroup, "MaxWordCount", MaxWordCount, defaults.MaxWordCount);
}
```
***
