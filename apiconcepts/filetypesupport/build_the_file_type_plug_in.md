Build the File Type Plug-in
===

This chapter contains important information on building your file type plug-in and on the plug-in package file, which is created during the building process.

The Plug-in Package
--

Building the project will generate a **.sdlplugin* file, in our example Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText.sdlplugin, which will be placed inside your build output path. The **.sdlplugin* file is technically speaking a ZIP archive that contains the required plug-in components such as the plug-in binary (*.dll itself), the resources file, the manifest etc. For our example, the **.sdlplugin* file will contain the following:

* The plug-in assembly, e.g. **Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText.dll**
* The plug-in manifest, e.g. **Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText.plugin.xml**. The manifest lists information on any extension classes that the plug-in contains. It is this manifest that will be created during the build process. It declares the assembly and the corresponding extension classes to Var:ProductName. By deleting this manifest **.xml* file you would actually deactivate the plug-in and 'hide' it from the application.
* The plug-in resources file, e.g. **Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText.plugin.resources**. This resources file contains all the localizable strings and images referred to within the plug-in manifest, and is compiled from **PluginResources.resx** (see also The [Resources File](the_resources_file.md)).

The Plug-in Package Path
--
In order for Var:ProductName to pick up the plug-in package and to extract it, the following folders need to be available on your hard drive:

**For Windows 10\ Windows 7\ Windows 8**:

* Var:PluginPackedPath *

and

* Var:PluginUnpackedPath *

Make sure that you place the **.sdlplugin* file into the sub-folder Packages and launch Var:ProductName. During startup of Var:ProductName the content of the package will be automatically extracted to the Unpacked sub-folder, as illustrated below:

The above folder does not have to be the build output path, but it is convenient to build the project in this folder, as this will also create the **.sdlplugin* file where it needs to be. After creating the plug-in based on the (empty) template, you could already build the project. However, it will, of course, not offer any functionality.

Upon start-up Var:ProductName will load the unpacked plug-in and show the following message, which you can confirm with **Yes**, so that the plug-in gets loaded. This message appears when loading plug-ins that have not been certified by RWS, which could potentially be unsafe. The message can be avoided by submitting your plug-in to RWS for certification.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a user clicks **No** when the plug-in security message is displayed during start-up of Var:ProductName, the plug-in will not be shown in the application.


After loading the plug-in in Var:ProductName, you can confirm that the plug-in has been added by raising the corresponding dialog box through the menu command **Tools** -> **Plug-ins**. The **Plug-ins** dialog box should list the name of your newly created plug-in:

The Plug-in Manifest
--
One essential piece of information required in order to build the plug-in package this is the plug-in package manifest, which is defined in the file **pluginpackage.manifest.xml**. This file is part of the project template. If this manifest is missing, the project package cannot be built.

Below you see what the manifest of our sample plug-in looks like:

# [Xml](#tab/tabid-1)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<PluginPackage xmlns="http://www.sdl.com/Plugins/PluginPackage/1.0">
  <PlugInName>Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText</PlugInName>
  <Version>1.0</Version>
  <Description>Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText</Description>
  <Author></Author>
  <RequiredProduct name="SDLTradosStudio" minversion="16.0" />
</PluginPackage>
```
***

The manifest contains the following information:
* **PlugInName**: indicates the friendly name of the plugin. This string be different from the name of the plug-in that is defined in PluginResources.resx. The reason for this is that a plug-in package can - in theory - contain multiple plug-ins, which need to be distinguished.
* **Version**: the version of the plug-in package. This information is used to detect any package updates upon start-up of Var:ProductName, and is therefore important.
* **Description**: descriptive information of the plug-in package.
* **Author**: the name of the plug-in developer.
* **RequiredProduct**: this string indicates which RWS product version is required to run the given plug-in. The information that you indicate here must include the minimum version, and can optionally include a maximum version.

Build and Debug Suggestions
--

Here are a couple of simple suggestions to help buld and debug your plug-in.

* Change your solution and project so that it runs Var:ProductName by default.
* Change your project so that it the output is directed to the Var:ProductName plug-in package directory - this will automatically deploy your plug-in. In Windows 7, the Var:ProductNameplug-in package directory is stored in Var:PluginPackedPath.
* Change your project so that it deletes the previous unpacked version of your plug-in - this will ensure that Studio uses the latest version of your plug-in. This can be done using a post-build event.

```txt
rmdir /S /Q "Var:PluginUnpackedPath \Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.Bil"
```
