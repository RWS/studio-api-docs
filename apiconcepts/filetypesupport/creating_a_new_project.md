Creating a New Project
===
In this chapter you will learn how to properly set up a project for developing a file type plug-in.

Create the Project
--

Before you start developing plug-ins for Var:ProductName, you should make sure that the SDK is installed on your development computer. The SDK installer will add new templates to your Microsoft Visual Studio environment, as illustrated in the screenshot below. For the type of plug-in discussed in this chapter, we require the **Var:ProductName Plug-in Project** template.

By default, when you create a project based on this template, the project name will be e.g. **Var:ProductName Plug-in Project1**. Change the project name to **Sdl.Sdk.FileTypeSupport.Samples.SimpleText** for our sample implementation.

Add the Required References
--

The plug-in template will come with the **Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.dll** reference. For our file type plug-in implementation, we also need to reference the File Type Support Framework, i.e. **Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.dll**. For implementing the functionality required by our example, you need to add the libraries used for integration with Var:ProductName, which are as follows:

* **Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.Settings.dll**
* **Sdl.Core.Settings.dll**
* **Sdl.Core.Globalization.dll**
* **Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.Utilities**

By default these files can be found in the installation folder of Var:ProductName, i.e. *Var:InstallationFolder*. The 'Copy Local' property for these references should be set to True.
