Code Examples
==
The following chapters provide practical examples of how to use the Project Automation API based on short, easy-to-understand code snippets.

# Use Cases Overview
* The code snippets cover a number of use cases:
* Programmatically creating projects and defining the project properties such as name, location, due date, etc.
* Running automated batch tasks (e.g. file analysis) and configuring the various task settings
* Configuring the TM settings for a project such as the minimum match value
* Creating projects based on reference projects or templates
* Merging multiple documents into one master file
* Changing projects, e.g. by adding an updated file
* Adding resources, i.e. * TMs and termbases to a project
* Creating project packages and assigning manual tasks
* Creating and importing return packages
* Deleting projects

# Sample Files

In the following examples we assume that there is a folder on your hard disk called *C:\ProjectFiles*. This folder has three sub-folders:

* **Documents**: Contains the files *brochure.pdf, options.jpg, Configuration.doc*, and *New_Features.ppt*.
* **Termbase**: Contains the sample termbase file *Software.sdltb*.
* **TMs**: Contains the four TM files: *Software En-De, General En-De, Software En-Fr*, and *General En-Fr*.
