Viewing and Deleting Published Projects
==

As well as allowing you to open a project, the [ProjectServer](../../api/projectautomation/Sdl.ProjectAutomation.FileBased.ProjectServer.yml) class provides methods to view existing projects on the server and delete projects from the server.

Viewing Server Projects
--

The following example shows how to view all the projects on the project server starting from a particular organization folder including all sub-folders.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-1)
```cs
Uri serverAddress = new Uri("http://myServerAddress:80");
string organizationPath = "/LocationOnServerToStartListFrom";

ProjectServer server = new ProjectServer(serverAddress, false, "MyUser", "MyPassword");
ServerProjectInfo[] projects = server.GetServerProjects(organizationPath, true, false);
```
***

This next example shows how to search for a particular product by name in a particular organization path. The result from the search is used to open the project and create a new workspace on the local machine.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-2)
```cs
string rootLocalProjectLocation = @"C:\Projects\";

 Uri serverAddress = new Uri("http://myServerAddress:80");

 ProjectServer server = new ProjectServer(serverAddress, false, "MyUser", "MyPassword");
 ServerProjectInfo projectInfo = server.GetServerProject("/MyOrganizationName/MyProjectName");

 FileBasedProject project;

 if (projectInfo!=null)
 {
     project = server.OpenProject(projectInfo.ProjectId, rootLocalProjectLocation + projectInfo.Name);
 }
```
***

Deleting server projects
--

The following example shows how to delete a project from the project server using the unique id for the project.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-3)
```cs
Uri serverAddress = new Uri("http://myServerAddress:80");

ProjectServer server = new ProjectServer(serverAddress, false, "MyUser", "MyPassword");
server.DeleteProject(projectId);
```
***

>[!NOTE]
>
>This only removes the project from the server and marks the local copy as deleted You can still access the local copy as a local project but any attempt to access the previously attached server will generate an exception
