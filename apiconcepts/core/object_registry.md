Object Registry
=====
This sections explains a couple of utility classes that can be used by host applications.


Object Registry
----
Often, the host application just needs to create an instance of all the extension implementations registered with a particular extension point.

In the example above, we explicitly went through the plug-in registry object model to illustrate how the various classes interact. However, to facilitate this common use case, thereâ€™s a helper class, called [ObjectRegistry<TExtensionAttribute, TExtensionType>](../../api/core/Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.ObjectRegistry-2.yml). This class allows the host application to quickly create a list of extension implementation objects as follows:

# [C#](#tab/tabid-1)
[!code-csharp[HostApplication](code_samples/HostApplication.cs#L75-L80)]
***

`ObjectRegistry<TExtensionAttribute, TExtensionType>` is a generic class accepting two template parameters:

* `TExtensionAttribute`: the extension attribute type defining the extension point
* `TExtensionType`: the common interface, that all extensions for this extension point must implement.
The `CreateObjects` method simply instantiates all the extension implementations and returns them in a typed array.
