Creating Translation Provider Plug-ins
======
This section provides an overview of how to create a translation provider plug-in, which allows applications like Var:ProductName to interact with automated translation engines, including AI-based NMT and LLM models, third-party translation memory implementations or other translation engines.

Overview
-----
A translation provider is a component which provides functionality to translate segments, i.e. sentences, from one language, the source language, into another language, the target language. A translation provider typically supports translation from many languages into many languages.

Examples of translation provider implementations are RWS Translation Memory, which performs translation of segments by looking them up in a file- or server-based translation memory database ([FileBasedTranslationMemory](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.FileBasedTranslationMemory.yml) or [ServerBasedTranslationMemory](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.yml)) and the RWS Automated Translation Provider, which performs translations using RWS's automated translation engine.

Var:ProductName uses translation providers for a number of tasks:

* During project preparation, in the Analyze, Populate Project Translation Memory and Pre-translate batch tasks.
* During interactive translation, when the user performs lookups for segments in a document that is being translated in the Var:ProductName editor.
* During project finalization, in the TM Update task.

As mentioned above, Var:ProductName comes with a number of built-in translation provider implementations. In addition, Var:ProductName provides a plug-in mechanism that allows third-parties to create translation provider plug-ins. In order to create a translation provider plug-in, you need to create a number of classes:

1. **Translation Provider**: This class represents the multilingual translation provider, which allows getting a Translation Provider Language Direction for a specific source-target language direction, which, in turn, exposes the translation functionality for that language direction. This translation provider class should implement the [ITranslationProvider](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ITranslationProvider.yml) interface.
2. **Translation Provider Language Direction**: This class exposes translation functionality for a specific source-target language direction.
3. **Translation Provider Factory Extension**: This is a plug-in framework extension class that can create instances of the translation provider based on a specific URI. Var:ProductName uses this class to create instances of translation providers from URIs that it has stored in translation projects. Every translation provider implementation should define a URI scheme that can be used to build URIs that uniquely identify the translation provider.
4. **Translation Provider UI Extension**: This is a plug-in framework extension class that provides user interface functionality that allows Var:ProductName to browse for translation providers, edit translation provider settings, and display translation providers in a unified way. Var:ProductName selects the appropriate UI Extension based on the translation provider URI.
   
The following diagram demonstrates how a translation plug-in is used by Var:ProductName:
