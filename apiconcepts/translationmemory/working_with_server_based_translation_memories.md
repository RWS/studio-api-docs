Working with Server-based Translation Memories
=====
This section describes how to work with server-based translation memories.

Overview
------
A server-based translation memory is a translation memory ([ITranslationMemory](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ITranslationMemory.yml)) that is hosted on TM Server. It is designed for multiple-user access and supports multiple language directions. A server-based translation memory is stored in a translation memory container ([TranslationMemoryContainer](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.TranslationMemoryContainer.yml)), which is a Microsoft SQL Server database.

Server-based translation memories are represented by the [ServerBasedTranslationMemory](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.yml) class. To create a server-based translation memory, create a new [ServerBasedTranslationMemory](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.yml) object, passing the [TranslationProviderServer](../..//api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.TranslationProviderServer.yml) on which the translation memory should be created into the constructor. Subsequently set all the required properties such as [Name](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.RemoteTranslationMemory.yml#Sdl_LanguagePlatform_TranslationMemoryApi_RemoteTranslationMemory_Name) and [Container](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.yml#Sdl_LanguagePlatform_TranslationMemoryApi_ServerBasedTranslationMemory_Container) and add language directions to the [LanguageDirections](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.yml#Sdl_LanguagePlatform_TranslationMemoryApi_ServerBasedTranslationMemory_LanguageDirections) collection. Optionally, add custom field definitions and language resources and finally call [Save](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.yml#Sdl_LanguagePlatform_TranslationMemoryApi_ServerBasedTranslationMemory_Save) to create the translation memory on the server.

In addition to the standard translation memory functionality, server-based translation memories have the following additional capabilities:

* **Field Templates**: instead of defining field definitions for every translation memory individually, server-based translation memories can inherit their field defintions from a fields template, represented by [ServerBasedFieldsTemplate](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedFieldsTemplate.yml). For more information, see [Working with Field Templates](working_with_field_templates.md).
* **Language Resource Templates**: same as with field templates, instead of defining language resources for every translation memory individually, server-based translation memories can inherit their language resources from a language resources template, represented by [ServerBasedLanguageResourcesTemplate](../../api/translationmemory/Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.ServerBasedLanguageResourcesTemplate.yml). For more information, see [Working with Language Resource Templates](working_with_language_resource_templates.md).
* **Scheduled import and export**: instead of importing remotely over the network or internet, you can schedule an import or export to be done on the server. For more information, see [Performing a Scheduled Import or Export](performing_a_scheduled_import_or_export.md).
