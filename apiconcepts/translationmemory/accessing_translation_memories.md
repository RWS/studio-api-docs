Accessing Translation Memories
=====
TMs can be accessed in two ways: either by opening a TM file stored on a hard disk or by connecting to a TM Server over LAN or WAN.

File-based TMs
----
When accessing a file-based TM users open an *.sdltm file, which is based on SQLite database technology. By default, file-based TMs are not password-protected. However, users may assign passwords for a number of access levels. Users with guest access, for example, can only read a TM. Users with the administrator access can perform any operation on a TM, e.g. maintenance, export, import, etc.

Server-based TMs
----
Server TMs are physically stored in a database system such as Microsoft SQL Server. 
The TM Server middleware negotiates the access between the client application and the server-based TMs. The TM Server software can be installed on the same machine as the database system or on a separate server computer. Server-based TMs can be accessed in a LAN through TCP or through the Web using HTTP or HTTPS.

A user who wants to access a server TM, requires the server address, the port, and a valid TM server user.
