What you can do with this SDK
=====
This page provides a quick overview of what you can do with the Translation Memory API.

The Translation Memory (TM) SDK allows you to create applications to automate a number of processes for TM related operations. Examples are as follows:

* Programmatically create file- or server-based TMs.
* Develop a command-line application that iterates through a folder/sub-folder structure and performs a batch import of multiple TMX files into a TM. Such an application can also be used to perform scheduled, regular import/export operations.
* Create an application that looks up segments or strings in one or several TMs.
* Develop a plug-in that allows you to access 3rd party translation providers from <Var:ProductName>, e.g. use an Web-based machine translation system, or simple, delimited text files.
* Integrate common TM lookup and editing functionality into a 3rd party application.
* Develop a Web-based application that allows you to perform searches in a number of server-based TMs.
Create a script that runs scheduled maintenance tasks to keep TMs lean and efficient.


This SDK features a number of usage examples that illustrate how to develop against the Translation Memory API. All examples provided have been written in C#.
