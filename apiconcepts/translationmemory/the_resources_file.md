The Resources File
======================
The resources file contains the strings and elements that users will see in the user interface of Var:ProductName such as the plug-in name, icon, description.

The **PluginResources.resx** file is among the components that are provided by the project template. This resources file contains, among others, a string value called **Plugin_Name**. It defines the name of the plug-in assembly and will be preset to the name of the Visual Studio project. This is the name that will show up in the Var:ProductName plug-in management dialog. Any localizable strings referred to from the plug-in attribute or extension attributes should be defined in **PluginResources.resx**. The **.resx* file will be compiled into a **.resources* file, and will be deployed outside of the plug-in assembly itself, so the host application can access the information within it without having to load the plug-in assembly itself.

The resources file for our project should look as shown below:

<img style="display:block; " src="images/Translation_Provider_PlugIn_Resources.jpg"/>

Here are some explanations on the string resources:

* The **Plugin_Name** is the one that will be shown in the **Plug-ins** dialog box of Var:ProductName (which end users will open only on rare occasions).
* **The Plugin_NiceName** is the one that will be displayed, for example, in the user interface of Var:ProductName when selecting a translation provider.
* **The Plugin_Tooltip** text will be displayed when users move the mouse pointer over the plug-in (nice) name or icon.
* **The Plugin_Description** contains further descriptive information on the plug-in.


> [!NOTE]
> 
> The value **Plugin_Description** is currently not supported, i.e. though you specify it, no plug-in description is currently shown in Var:ProductName.


In our implementation we also add an icon file (*band_aid.ico*) to the resources. The icon will later be displayed in the user interface of Var:ProductName, which makes the plug-in more visually appealing.

The screenshot below illustrates how your plug-in will be shown in the UI of Var:ProductName after the user has selected it as a provider for a translation project:

<img style="display:block; " src="images/PluginResourcesInAction.jpg"/>

In the same manner we add a *.png* file called *band_aid.png* to the resources. This image will be displayed later when a match has been found in the translation provider. This helps users distinguish your implementation from other translation providers.

The screenshot below illustrates how a match from your translation provider will later be shown to the user in Var:ProductName, i.e. the plug-in graphic and the name:

<img style="display:block; " src="images/PngForShowingResults.jpg"/>


> [!NOTE]
> 
> We recommend that you use an image with a transparent background for your plug-in.
