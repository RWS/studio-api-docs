Setting up the Project
=====
In this chapter you will learn how to develop a simple command-line application for creating TMs and importing multiple *.tmx files in Var:VisualStudioEdition using C#.

Start by creating a new Console Application called Sdl.**SDK.LanguagePlatform.Samples.BatchImport**.

The project requires the following libraries as references:

* Sdl.Core.TM.ImportExport
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.Core
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemory
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi

The classes in your project should use the following namespaces:

* System.IO
* System.Xml
* System.Globalization
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.Core.Tokenization
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemory
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi

> [!NOTE]
> 
> We require the XML API to retrieve information from the *.tmx files, i.e. the source and the target language locale.
