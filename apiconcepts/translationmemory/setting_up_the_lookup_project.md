Setting up the Project
=====
On this page you will learn how to set up the project for designing our custom TM lookup application in C#.

Create a new WPF application in Var:VisualStudioEdition called **Sdl.SDK.LanguagePlatform.Samples.TmLookup**.


<img style="display:block; " src="images/CreateLookupProject.jpg"/>

Then add the following references to your project:

* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.Core
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemory
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi

<img style="display:block; " src="images/ReferencesLookupApp.jpg"/>

>[!Note]
>
> At the time of writing of this version of the SDK it was required to set the build path folder to the directory that contains the Var:ProductName debug build.
