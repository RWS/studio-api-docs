Maintaining Translation Memories
====
From time to time users may have to perform maintenance work on a TM.

Maintaining a TM can involve, among others, the following typical tasks:

* Browsing through a TM to review translation units
* Doing global find/replace operations, e.g. to replace outdated terminology with up-to-date terms
* Apply certain field values to a number of TUs, e.g. add the field value Customer > Microsoft to several TUs in one go
* Delete a set of TUs that are outdated or incorrect
* Tune a TM for performance
* Identify and remove potential duplicate units that clutter the TM
* Filter for a subset of the TM, e.g. all units created on or after a specific date
  
  
  In <Var:ProductName>, the maintenance work is typically done by users in a side-by-side TM view.
