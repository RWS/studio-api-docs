Creating the Master Translation Memories
======
Remember that all *.tmx files of the same language direction need to be consolidated in a master TM. If the importer class (see [Importing into the Master Translation Memories](importing_into_the_master_translation_memories.md)) determines that the corresponding master TM does not yet exist, it should be created through a separate class. On this page you will learn how to implement the class for creating the master TMs.

Add a New Class
-----
Start by adding a new class called `TmCreator` to your project. Add a public function called `CreateMasterTm`, which takes the path in which the master TMs should be created and the source/target language locales as string parameters.

Create the Master TM
------
In the next step, implement the logic required for creating the master TM file. Note that for simplicity's sake, the file name is a combination of a hard-coded string *(MasterTM_)*, the language direction string, and the extension *.sdltm.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-1)
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Create the master TM based on the source and target locales found in the current TMX file.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sourceLanguage">String representation of translation memory source language.</param>
/// <param name="targetLanguage">String representation of translation memory target language.</param>
/// <param name="masterPath">Path to translation memory.</param>
public void CreateMasterTm(string sourceLanguage, string targetLanguage, string masterPath)
{
    #region "Create Translation Memory"

    string path = string.Format(
        CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,
        "{0}MasterTm_{1}_{2}.sdltm",
        masterPath,
        sourceLanguage,
        targetLanguage);

    var translationMemory = new FileBasedTranslationMemory(
        path,
        "Master TM",
        CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(sourceLanguage),
        CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(targetLanguage),
        this.GetFuzzyIndexes(),
        this.GetRecognizers(),
        TokenizerFlags.AllFlags,
        WordCountFlags.AllFlags
        );

    #endregion

    #region "Save"

    translationMemory.LanguageResourceBundles.Clear();
    translationMemory.Save();

    #endregion
}
```
****


The fuzzy indexes are determined through a separate helper function:
# [C#](#tab/tabid-2)
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Configure the fuzzy indexes, to determine, for example,
/// that the master TM should support concordance searching 
/// in the target language.
/// The fuzzy indexes for source and target should be word-based only
/// i.e. not character-based for performance reasons. (Master TMs
/// can be assumed to be big, and therefore slow on character-based searches.)
/// </summary>
/// <returns>Hard-coded SourceWordBased and TargetWordBased FuzzyIndexes type</returns>
private FuzzyIndexes GetFuzzyIndexes()
{
    return FuzzyIndexes.SourceWordBased | FuzzyIndexes.TargetWordBased;
}
```
****


Also, the recognition settings are set in a distinct helper function:

# [C#](#tab/tabid-3)
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Configure the recognition settings for the TM.
/// Here, we simply activate all recognition settings 
/// through RecognizeAll, which includes recognition
/// of variables, dates, numbers, acronyms, measurements, and times.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>Hard-coded RecognizeAll BuiltinRecognizer.</returns>
private BuiltinRecognizers GetRecognizers()
{
    return BuiltinRecognizers.RecognizeAll;
}
```

Putting it All Together

The complete class should look as shown below:

        /// <param name="targetLanguage">String representation of translation memory target language.</param>
        /// <param name="masterPath">Path to translation memory.</param>
        public void CreateMasterTm(string sourceLanguage, string targetLanguage, string masterPath)
        {

                masterPath,
                sourceLanguage,
                targetLanguage);
