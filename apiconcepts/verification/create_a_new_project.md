Create a New Project
====

In this chapter you will learn how to properly set up a project for developing a global verification plug-in.

Create the Project
-----
Before you start developing plug-ins for Var:ProductName, you should make sure that the SDK is installed on your development computer. The SDK installer will add new templates to your Var:VisualStudioEdition environment, as illustrated in the screenshot below. For the type of plug-in discussed in this chapter, we require the **Var:ProductName (2021)** project template.

By default, when you create a project based on this template, the project name will be e.g. **Trados Studio1**. Change the project name to **Sdl.Verification.Sdk.IdenticalCheck** for our sample implementation.

Add the Required References
-----
The plug-in template will come with the **Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.dll** reference. For our global verifier implementation, we also need to reference the Verification API, i.e. **Sdl.Verification.Api.dll**. For implementing the functionality required by our example, you need to add the libraries used for integration with Var:ProductName, which are as follows:

* **Sdl.Desktop.Platform.dll**
* **Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core**
* **Sdl.Core.Settings.dll**
  
By default, these files can be found in the installation folder of Var:ProductName, i.e. *Var:InstallationFolder*. The 'Copy Local' property for these references should be set to True.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not forget to sign the assembly. Otherwise, your plug-in might not be loaded by Var:ProductName.
