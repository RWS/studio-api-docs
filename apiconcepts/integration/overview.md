 Var:ProductName Integration API
 -----
The Var:ProductName Integration API enables third-party developers to add or customize new functionalities in Studio applications and more specific to Var:ProductName application (for more information see: [What you can do with the Integration API](what_you_can_do_with_the_integration_API.md)).

The main topics of the Var:ProductName Integration API are:

* [User interface integration](user_interface_integration.md)
* [Studio automation integration](studio_automation.md)

Var:ProductName's architecture is modular, being based on components called plug-ins, set up both at the system level (for the built-in features) and as extensions provided by the community and installed by end users. Here is a small diagram illustrating this approach:
