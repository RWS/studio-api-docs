Var:ProductName application initializers
=====
Integration API makes it easy to execute code when Var:ProductName starts, so you can initialize your plugin. All you need to do is implement [IApplicationInitializer](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.IApplicationInitializer.yml) interface, from `Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi` namespace and decorate your class with [ApplicationInitializerAttribute](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Extensions.ApplicationInitializerAttribute.yml). If you fail to implement [IApplicationInitializer](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.IApplicationInitializer.yml), an exception will be thrown, but if you omit the [ApplicationInitializerAttribute](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Extensions.ApplicationInitializerAttribute.yml), your plugin will simply be ignored when Var:ProductName Starts.

Example
----
The following example demonstrates a simple plugin data initialization. This plugin measures the time since Var:ProductName has been opened and if you worked less than required, it displays a warning MessageBox.

This example also demonstrates how to cleanup when Var:ProductName exits. All you have to do is subscribe to `Application.Closing` event. You can use `CancelEventArgs` to prevent Var:ProductName from closing.
