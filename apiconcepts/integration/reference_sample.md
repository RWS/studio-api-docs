Reference Sample
======
The Integration API provides support for third-party developers to integrate actions, ribbon groups, views and view parts within Var:ProductName. The reference sample takes advantage of these features to provide a working example.

Description
-----
The reference sample demonstrates how the different extension points offered by the Var:ProductName Integration API can be used to create a fully functional plug-in. Custom actions, ribbon groups, views and view parts are blended together to provide an example in which a working folder (local drive or network location) is used as a drop location for files to be translated. The Var:ProductName user can then see the files grouped by folders and create projects based on the name of each folder. Furthermore, this sample extends the translation editor functionality to allow the Var:ProductName user to search Wikipedia for words and phrases found in the document.

The custom list features:

[Content Connector](content_connector.md)

[Project Creator](project_creator.md)

[Wikipedia search and results view part](wikipedia_search.md)
