Reference Sample
======
The Integration API provides support for third-party developers to integrate actions, ribbon groups, views and view parts within <Var:ProductName>. The reference sample takes advantage of these features to provide a working example.

Description
-----
The reference sample demonstrates how the different extension points offered by the <Var:ProductName> Integration API can be used to create a fully functional plug-in. Custom actions, ribbon groups, views and view parts are blended together to provide an example in which a working folder (local drive or network location) is used as a drop location for files to be translated. The <Var:ProductName> user can then see the files grouped by folders and create projects based on the name of each folder. Furthermore, this sample extends the translation editor functionality to allow the <Var:ProductName> user to search Wikipedia for words and phrases found in the document.
