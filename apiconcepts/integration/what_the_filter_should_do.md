What the filter should do
======
Learn how to develop a custom display filter by following the creation of a simplified sample project which uses the Display Filter API.

The example custom display filter will be a simple control where the filter is applied on the active document from the editor. Our sample project will contain simplified code examples that show you how to implement:

* An integration of the display filter in the Trados Studio UI.
* The addition of some filters to be applied on source and target segments.
* An assertion of whether or not the segments should be visible in the Trados Studio Editor.
