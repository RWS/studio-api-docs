Find out what the Display Filter API does and how you can leverage it to create a custom filter.

What is a Custom Display Filter?
---
In Var:ProductName, a display filter limits the display of segments in the Editor based on specific attributes. Third-party developers can integrate their own custom display filters that can process the segments in the Var:ProductName Editor.

The Advanced Display Filter that ships with Var:ProductName is an example of an implementation based on the Display Filter API. The Advanced Display Filter enables Var:ProductName power-users to access more segment filtering options than the standard Display Filter does.

To access the Advanced Display Filter the user has to click **View > Advanced Display Filter**.

In the Advanced Display Filter window, end-users can create and save filters based on:

* segment content - this displays the segments that contain a certain text in source or target.
* filter attributes - users can filter by a certain segment status, a certain origin or by other attributes.
* comments - users can further refine their search by displaying only segments reviewed and commented by a certain person or segments with a certain severity.
* document structure - this filters by document structure elements.

Working with the Advanced Display Filter
-----
End-users can set the attributes they need to filter segments in the Var:ProductName Editor in the tabs of the Advanced Display Filter.

They could, for example, filter segments by their source and target text.

Moving on, they could choose from a range of segment attributes that could be applied to the filter, for example segment status, translation origin or review mode.

If, for example, an end-user wants to display the segments that were commented by a certain reviewer on a certain topic, they could filter by that.

And finally, end-users can filter segments by their document structure.
