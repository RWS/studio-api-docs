Find out what the Display Filter API does and how you can leverage it to create a custom filter.

What is a Custom Display Filter?
---
In Trados Studio, a display filter limits the display of segments in the Editor based on specific attributes. Third-party developers can integrate their own custom display filters that can process the segments in the Trados Studio Editor.

The Advanced Display Filter that ships with Trados Studio is an example of an implementation based on the Display Filter API. The Advanced Display Filter enables Trados Studio power-users to access more segment filtering options than the standard Display Filter does.

To access the Advanced Display Filter the user has to click **View > Advanced Display Filter**.

In the Advanced Display Filter window, end-users can create and save filters based on:

* segment content - this displays the segments that contain a certain text in source or target.
* filter attributes - users can filter by a certain segment status, a certain origin or by other attributes.
* comments - users can further refine their search by displaying only segments reviewed and commented by a certain person or segments with a certain severity.
* document structure - this filters by document structure elements.

Working with the Advanced Display Filter
-----
End-users can set the attributes they need to filter segments in the Trados Studio Editor in the tabs of the Advanced Display Filter.

They could, for example, filter segments by their source and target text.

Moving on, they could choose from a range of segment attributes that could be applied to the filter, for example segment status, translation origin or review mode.

If, for example, an end-user wants to display the segments that were commented by a certain reviewer on a certain topic, they could filter by that.

And finally, end-users can filter segments by their document structure.
