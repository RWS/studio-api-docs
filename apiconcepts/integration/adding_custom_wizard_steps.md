# Adding custom steps to wizards
<Var:ProductName> Integration API provides support for third-party developers to add custom pages to certain wizards within the <Var:ProductName> desktop application. You can add custom pages using WPF views and view-models.

*For the moment, only the __Open Package wizard__ supports this functionality. Support for other wizards may come in the future.*

Creating pages to use as wizard steps
----
In order to create a view that can be used as a wizard step, a third-party developer needs to:

* Create a WPF view file, e.g. `UserControl`, with custom XAML and/or code behind.
* Create a ViewModel for the view, if necessary.
* Create a new class representing the custom page.
    * This class needs to inherit from the abstract [StudioWizardPage](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Wizard.StudioWizardPage.yml).
    * Implement the required abstract properties.

## StudioWizardPage base class
The [StudioWizardPage](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Wizard.StudioWizardPage.yml) abstract class comes with a default implementation for some of the methods and properties required to define a custom wizard page. You can further override these methods and properties to provide your own custom logic.

## StudioWizardPage properties
Some of the properties are represented on the user interface directly, as shown below:

### ViewType
* Set the `ViewType` property to the actual type of the WPF view file. <Var:ProductName>'s infrastructure uses the type to inject the view into the wizard's user interface. You can use the `typeof` C# keyword (`GetType` in VB) to obtain the view type needed here.

### ViewModel
* The wizard infrastructure automatically assigns the `ViewModel` as DataContext to the view, so you can use `Binding` from the view to the ViewModel properties. If you don't need a ViewModel just assign `null` here.
* For the `ViewModel` you can use any INotifyPropertyChanged implementation suits you best, such as providing your own or using an MVVM framework.

### IsAvailable
* This property is used by the wizard framework when navigating to other pages to determine if a page should be displayed. 
* When the user clicks **Next** the wizard checks through the subsequent pages and displays the first one that is available. The **Next** button is disabled when there are no more pages for which `IsAvailable` returns `true`.
* When the user clicks **Back** the wizard checks through the previous pages and displays the first one that is available. The **Back** button is disabled when there are no more pages for which `IsAvailable` returns `true`.

### Data
* You can define custom data for your pages using the `Data` property on the [StudioWizardPage](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Wizard.StudioWizardPage.yml) object.
* The Data property is a `Dictionary<string,object>` that is common to all wizard pages. 
* Once a dictionary key is set from a page, it becomes available to any pages that are displayed after it. This includes pages that are navigated to via the **Back** button. 
* You can use the Page's `OnShow` method to query for the most recent key values that may have been updated/inserted by previously shown pages.
* The `Data` property is initialized for all pages before the wizard is displayed.

### Icon
* Set this property to display an icon in the top-right area of the page.
* Set this property to `null` if you don't want an icon displayed.

### Id
* This property is used by the wizard framework to uniquely identify the pages.

  
# Integrating pages as steps into <Var:ProductName> wizards
Custom pages are injected into the wizard via the `firstPages` argument of the event object corresponding to the respective wizard. Keep in mind that the `firstPages` argument is available only for some wizard event objects.
 
To inject the custom pages as steps into a <Var:ProductName> wizard:

* Determine or define a place in your code to launch the wizard (with custom steps) from; for example, from an [Action](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.AbstractAction.yml)'s `Execute` method.
* Determine the appropriate event (e.g. [OpenProjectPackageEvent](../../api/integration/Sdl.TranslationStudioAutomation.IntegrationApi.Events.OpenProjectPackageEvent.yml)) to be raised, that corresponds to the wizard you want to open.
* Set up a `List` of [StudioWizardPage](../../api/integration/Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Wizard.StudioWizardPage.yml) instances, which represent the custom pages you want to insert in the wizard
* Create the event, passing in `firstPages` list as an argument.
* Use the event aggregator to raise the event. This will launch the wizard.

Notes:
* The custom pages appear in the wizard at the beginning, before any other standard pages.
* The custom pages appear in the wizard in the same order they are defined in the list configured in the event object.

Wizard conceptual execution flow

The diagram below briefly describes the wizard's execution sequence, and shows the order in which `StudioWizardPage` properties and methods are called by the framework at runtime.
