Building a plug-in
====
This section focuses on how to create a new third-party plug-in for <Var:ProductName> using one of the standard Visual Studio project templates and offers some information on how this works under the hood.

Building a Plug-in
-----
Since <Var:ProductName> is a Microsoft .NET Framework application, third-party plug-ins should be developed using Microsoft .Net Framework 4.8. The <Var:ProductName> SDK comes with a number of Visual Studio project templates, which give you a quick start to creating various types of plug-ins.

In this topic, we will be creating a Translation Provider plug-in as an example. We will only focus on aspects common to all types of plug-ins. 

First of all, make sure that you have followed the [Setting up a Developer Machine](setting_up_a_developer_machine.md) information.

Start Visual Studio and click New Project. Select one of the <Var:ProductName> project templates that are available. If you don't see any <Var:ProductName> project templates, make sure you have installed the latest <Var:ProductName> SDK version from the developer hub.

The project templates already contains stubs for all the classes you will have to implement to create a new plugin.

First, open `PluginProperties.cs`, which is located next to the `AssemblyInfo.cs` file in the Properties folder. This contains a single Plugin attribute, which is what fundamentally makes this project a plug-in project. "Plugin_Name" is a resource string defined in `PluginResources.resx`.

# [C#](#tab/tabid-1)
```cs
[assembly: Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.Plugin("Plugin_Name")]
```
***

Open the `PluginResources.resx` file. You'll see that this contains a string value called `Plugin_Name`.

This defines the name of the plug-in assembly and will be preset to the name of the Visual Studio project. This is the name that will show up in the <Var:ProductName> plug-in management dialog. Any localizable strings referred to from the plug-in attribute or extension attributes should be defined in `PluginResources.resx`. This ".resx" file will be compiled into a ".resources" file and will be deployed outside of the plug-in assembly itself, so the host application can access the information within it without having to load the plug-in assembly itself.

Every third-party plug-in has to be deployed using a Plug-in Package (*.sdlplugin). This is an OPC-based file format, essentially a ZIP file, that contains the plug-in assembly, plug-in manifest file and the plug-in resources file. All Visual Studio project templates that come with the <Var:ProductName> SDK are configured to automatically create a plug-in package when the project is built. One essential piece of information required in order to do this is the plug-in package manifest, which is defined in the file `pluginpackage.manifest.xml` that was part of the project template.

[!code-xml[ReportXSLT](code_samples/pluginpackage.manifest.xml)]		

The plug-in package manifest defines some pieces of essential information:

* **PlugInName**: the friendly name of the plugin. This can be different to the name of the plug-in defined in `PluginResources.resx`, because a plug-in package can in theory contain multiple plug-ins.
* **Version**: the version of the plug-in package. This is important, as it will be used to detect updated packages. For more information, see [Plug-in deployment](plugin_deployment.md).
* **Description**: description of the plug-in package.
* **Author**: the name of the plug-in author
* **RequiredProduct**: this indicates which product this plug-in supports. This must include the minimum version and can optionally include a maximum version. <br>
If the minimum version is set to *<var:VersionNumber>.1* that means the plugin can be installed only in <Var:ProductName> SR1 and above.
* **Include**: a list of additional files to be included into the plugin package.

Any plugin project need to have the following nuget packages refrenced : 

* [Sdl.Core.PluginFramework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sdl.Core.PluginFramework/): this package provides the API's for the extension points
* [Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.Build](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.Build/): this package provides the plug-in manifest creation build step, which uses the standard MSBuild extension mechanism. See [Plug-in manifest generator](xref:the_plugin_manifest_generator.md).

> [!NOTE]
> `Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.Build` is needed only in build time.

Now build the project and have a look in the project output folder. Notice the following:

* The plug-in assembly, `MyPlugin.dll`
* A "Plugins" folder, which contains:
    * The plug-in manifest, `MyPlugin.plugin.xml`, which lists information about all the extension classes. the plug-in contains.
    * The neutral plug-in resources file `MyPlugin.plugin.resources`, which contains all the localizable strings and images referred to within the plug-in manifest. This was compiled from `PluginResources.resx`.
* The plug-in package, `MyPlugin.sdlplugin` which contains all of the above, together with the plug-in package manifest. </br>


After all the relevant information was added, build the project. Plugin can be found at the following local path *<var:PluginPackedPath>* if the default path wasn't changed. </br>

If in the console following error appears: `Error 1 Failed to locate ResGen.exe and unable to compile plug-in resource file...` please make sure you have installed [.Net Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48). 


Now, we are ready to deploy the plug-in package in <Var:ProductName>. See [Plug-in deployment](plugin_deployment.md).
