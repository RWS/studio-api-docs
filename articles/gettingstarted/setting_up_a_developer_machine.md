Setting up a Developer Machine
=====
Make sure you have the right prerequisites and meet the system requirements to develop applications that leverage the <Var:ProductName> public APIs.

Prerequisites
----

* For the development environment, we recommend using <var:VisualStudioEdition>.
* You need a licensed <Var:ProductNameWithEdition> or later installed on your development machine
* We also recommend installation of the **<Var:ProductName> SDK** on your machine. Note that after the installation of **<Var:ProductName> SDK**, the **New Project** dialog box from <var:VisualStudioEdition> will feature additional project templates specific to the <Var:ProductName> application development.
  * You can get the latest version from the [developer hub](https://appstore.sdl.com/language/developers/sdk.html). 
  * Or you can install directly from <var:VisualStudioEdition> -> Tools -> Extensions
  <img style="display:block; " src="images/VisualStudioExtensions.png" />
* If your implementations need to connect to a TM Server system, then make sure that the TM Server also runs the latest version.
* If you are developing against a version of API the which is distributed with one of SDL's publicly released applications (i.e. <Var:ProductNameWithEdition>), then all required assemblies and files should be available alongside the application. Make sure that you have the latest release of <Var:ProductName> installed.
  
> [!NOTE]
>
> As build output path for your implementations please choose the <var:PluginPackedPath>
>
> Also check that your library references are pointing to the <Var:ProductName> folder. e.g. <var:InstallationFolder>.
>
> For more informations regarding how to build and deploy a Studio plug-in see [Building a plug-in](building_a_plugin.md) and [Plug-in deployment](plugin_deployment.md)
>
> Sign and use Strong-Named Assemblies to enable the loading of your plug-ins inside <Var:ProductName>. For more information see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/sign-strong-name?redirectedfrom=MSDN) </br>
> If you don't have a key, you can download [SdlCommunity.snk](https://github.com/RWS/Sdl-Community) key from public AppStore repository.
> 
> Choosing a different build output path or not signing your assembly will prevent your plugin to be loaded.
